# Facial-Recognition

I have created 3 seperate files each for collecting data, training and recognizing.

Haarcascade classifier has been used to detect faces in the image.

I have used LBPH algorithm to train the features and recognize the images.
LBPH stands for local binary battern histogram.

The following blog has the detailed description of the working of LPBH algorithm:
